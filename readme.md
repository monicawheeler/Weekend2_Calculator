## Weekend Project Planning
- [x] Project initialization: setup files and init git/npm
- [x] DOM: two inputs for values, and buttons for Add, Subtract, multiply, divide, and equals - results output
- [x] Event listeners to capture values 
- [x] Values bundled into an object
- [x] POST on client to app.post on server
- [x] Create module that handles calculations, export and require
- [x] Calculation:
    - [x] the values of the object set as variables in order to calculate the return value
    - [x] the values of add, Subtract, etc set as an if statement to condition out the calcs
- [x] Add class to create object
- [x] GET from the server to the client side the result
- [x] GET from the server the response & history as a string to append to the DOM
- [x] Clear button to reset:
    - [x] Clear history
    - [x] Clear inputs
- [x] Fix history list so it doesn't append with each calc
- [x] Fix history list so it doesn't load the last item in the array
- [x] Style buttons

## Hard Mode
- [ ] Convert inputs to numerical buttons

## Fixes
- [x] Update button classes to make more DRY
- [x] Review history so it loads entire list
- [ ] Get the results and add to the object rather than create a unique array
