## Weekend Project Initial Planning
- [x] Project initialization: setup files and init git/npm
- [x] DOM: two inputs for values, and buttons for Add, Subtract, multiply,
divide, and equals
- [x] Event listeners to capture values 
- [x] Values bundled into an object
- [ ] POST on client to app.post on server
- [ ] Create module that handles calculations
- [ ] Calculation:
    - [ ] the values of the object set as variables in order to calculate the return value
    - [ ] the values of add, Subtract, etc set as an if statement to condition out the calcs
- [ ] GET from the server to the client side the result
- [ ] GET from the server the history as a string to append to the DOM
- [ ] Clear button to reset:
    - [ ] Clear history
    - [ ] Clear inputs
- [ ] Style buttons

## Hard Mode
- [ ] Convert inputs to numerical buttons
